## Antennas
The dBi rating on an antenna means how much signal strength it has compared to an omnidirectional antenna (one that broadcasts in all directions). So if you find a 20 dBi antenna that means that it is probably highly directional, not that it magically transmits at a higher strength than any other one. What this generally means is that the signal is focused in a "lighthouse" pattern around the antenna.   

* We like [Rokland](https://store.rokland.com/collections/all-helium-antennnas) antennas.

    * It excels as a vehicle antenna, and as a pole-node antenna, as it's very low visibility and catches very little wind. 
    * Also they all come with a sticker on the base which clearly indicates that this antenna is not garbage.
