## Picking The Right Node

When picking a node, there are a few things to consider. Where is it going? How much power does it take? What role will it play in the network?    
To simplify this process, we have created a few categories of nodes:   
- **Pocket Node**: A node that you intend to carry around on your person that is battery powered.   
- **Car Node**: A node that is mounted in a vehicle and is typically powered by the car's battery.    
- **Headquarter / House Node**: A node that is permanently installed where you live or work. These are typically powered by [shore power](jargon.md#shore-power) or by batteries and solar panels.   
- **Infrastructure Node**: A node that is permanently installed in a strategic location, such as a tall building, top of a hill, or other high point. These nodes are usually powered with a battery and solar panel, or shore power.
   
For each of these categories, we have a few types of recommendations for each given node category:   
- **Optimal Node**: This is the best node to use.
- **Budget Node**: This is the best node to use if you are on a budget.
- **Premade Node**: This is the best node to use if you want a premade solution.

## Pocket Node
A good pocket node is small, lightweight, and has a long battery life. In general, they sacrifice transmit power for portability.
