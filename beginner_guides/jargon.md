## Definitions

### Shore Power
Shore power is a term used to describe the power that is supplied to a device or system from an external source, such as a wall outlet or generator. In the context of MSPMesh, shore power typically refers to the power supplied to a node that is permanently installed in a location where it can be plugged into an electrical outlet. This is in contrast to battery-powered nodes, which rely on batteries for power.

### Splash
Splash is a term used to describe the area that a node can "see" from its location. This area is typically represented as a red splash on a map, indicating the coverage area of the node. The splash is generated using HeyWhatsThat, which estimates the coverage area based on the height and location of the node.
